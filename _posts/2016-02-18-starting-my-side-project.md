I was thinking to work on a side project for a long time, but I had no clear idea about the kind of project.
I want to work on something I like, a product usefull for me hoping it may be usefull also for others.
In the same way I want to learn new things, experimenting new frameworks, new languages, new technologies.

But this is not the only reason I'd like to work on a side project.

> One of the reasons I developed it [[Flask.io](http://flask.io/), a simple to-do list website] is to experiment. I decide what tools I want to try. I use them and determine if they are useful. I don’t need to train anyone else. I don’t need to ask for permission. I don’t need to hold a meeting. I just do it.
