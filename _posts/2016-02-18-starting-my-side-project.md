I was thinking to work on a side project for a long time, but I had no clear idea about the kind of project.
I want to work on something I like, a product usefull for me hoping it may be usefull also for others.
In the same way I want to learn new things, experimenting new frameworks, new languages, new technologies.

But this is not the only reason I'd like to work on a side project. 
As [Lee Munroe](https://twitter.com/leemunroe) wrote in his post [Side Projects Are Your Playground](https://medium.com/@leemunroe/side-projects-are-your-playground-a8d1fec5379d), 

> [side projects] let you learn new things, have fun and experiment.
> Unlike a typical day job, you get to be in control. You get to do what you want to do. No clients. No managers. No bureaucracy. And you get to ship your own product.

## Readability: the origins
[Readability](http://lab.arc90.com/2009/03/02/readability/) is a browser bookmarklet (sort of like a bookmark on steroids). Readability works with most major modern browsers and has been tested on many news sites and blogs. It isnâ€™t 100% effective but works surprisingly well.

The Readability code (including setup pages and supporting assets) is [available on Google Code](http://code.google.com/p/arc90labs-readability/).

This experiment inspired at least three products:

* Readability - [Google Play](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.readability)
* Pocket (Read It Later) - [Google Play](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.ideashower.readitlater.pro)
* Instapaper - [Google Play](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.instapaper.android)

* [Pocket](https://getpocket.com/) -  [Google Play](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.ideashower.readitlater.pro)
* [Instapaper](https://www.instapaper.com/) - [Google Play](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.instapaper.android)
