[Readability](http://lab.arc90.com/2009/03/02/readability/) is a browser bookmarklet (sort of like a bookmark on steroids). Readability works with most major modern browsers and has been tested on many news sites and blogs. It isnâ€™t 100% effective but works surprisingly well.

The Readability code (including setup pages and supporting assets) is [available on Google Code](http://code.google.com/p/arc90labs-readability/).

This experiment inspired at least three products:

* [Pocket](https://getpocket.com/) -  [Google Play](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.ideashower.readitlater.pro)
* [Instapaper](https://www.instapaper.com/) - [Google Play](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.instapaper.android)
* [Readability](https://www.readability.com/) - [Google Play](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.readability)
